# Hey 👋

My name is Ualzem Campos, i'm from Brazil. I have a degree  in Information Systems since December 2019 👨🏻‍🎓. I am looking for an opportunity to work with development. I always like to be learning new things. I am very easy to learn and to work in a team. Because I live in a small town, which does not have much opportunity in my area of ​​expertise, it is that I am looking for jobs in the home office mode.
